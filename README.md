SagaraOps is an open-source incident triage tool for Linux diagnostics.
It ingests `sosreport` bundles, extracts operational signals, prioritizes severity, and produces actionable summaries for faster troubleshooting.

---

## Problem

When incidents happen, teams often receive large diagnostic bundles (`sosreport`) that are difficult to parse quickly. Common pain points:

- critical signals are buried in thousands of lines of logs,
- triage quality depends on individual experience,
- handover quality is inconsistent,
- response time increases during off-hours.

---

## Solution

SagaraOps provides a structured triage pipeline:

1. **Ingest** report bundles via API/dashboard.
2. **Queue** analysis jobs for asynchronous processing.
3. **Parse** key system signals (errors, OOM, disk, service failures, etc.).
4. **Classify** severity using deterministic rules.
5. **Summarize** findings with local AI (Ollama), with fallback when AI is unavailable.
6. **Expose** results through API and web dashboard.

---

## Current Capabilities

- Upload report files from the web dashboard
- Queue-based background processing (Redis + worker)
- PostgreSQL-backed report state and summaries
- Structured parser for core incident signals (kernel, memory, disk, service, network)
- Rule-based severity classification with evidence snippets
- AI-assisted summarization with local model endpoint (`Ollama`)
- Report export endpoints (Markdown and PDF)
- CI workflow for API/web validation

## Tech Stack

- **Web:** Next.js
- **API:** FastAPI
- **Worker:** Python
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Queue:** Redis
- **AI runtime:** Ollama (local)
- **Container orchestration:** Docker Compose
- **CI:** GitHub Actions

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop / Docker Engine with Compose
- Git

### Run locally

```bash
# from repo root
cp .env.example .env
cd infra/docker
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open:

- Web: `http://localhost:3000`
- API health: `http://localhost:8000/health`

Optional (AI model):

```bash
docker exec -it docker-ollama-1 ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

---

## API (current)

- `GET /health` — API health check
- `POST /v1/reports/upload` — upload report file
- `GET /v1/reports` — list reports
- `GET /v1/reports/{report_id}` — report detail (includes structured findings)
- `GET /v1/reports/{report_id}/export.json` — export machine-readable report package (`?download=1` for file download)
- `GET /v1/reports/{report_id}/export.md` — export markdown report
- `GET /v1/reports/{report_id}/export.pdf` — export PDF report
- `GET /v1/reports/{report_id}/export.bundle` — export ZIP bundle (`.json + .md + .pdf`)
